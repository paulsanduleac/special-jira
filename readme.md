# JIRA Issue Manager

The purpose of the project is to allow the client's team to create JIRA issues without opening JIRA.
This would allow them to have an issue key to be used as branch name and in the commit messages, while allowing the our team to know what they're trying to accomplish when reviewing the submitted code.

## Features
- Create an issue in JIRA by submitting a form
- Find issues created by this user in the past
- Verify status of issues created in the past
- Access and update the description of past issues
