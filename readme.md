# JIRA Issue Manager

JIRA cloud does not allow setting permissions per field, so this project would serve as a bridge for a user to have minimal access to create JIRA issues and maybe update them.
This would allow them to have an issue key to be used as branch name and in the commit messages, while allowing the our team to know what they're trying to accomplish when reviewing the submitted code.

## Features
- Create an issue in JIRA by submitting a form
- Find issues created by this user in the past
- Verify status of issues created in the past
- Access and update the description of past issues
